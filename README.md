Hi guys! I'm Eduardo Vedes (@evedes) and I've challenged myself in the first of January to reboot my career in 360 days. I've chosen to pursue a Full Stack Developer career. In order to achieve that I've started studying and practicing along in [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com). I've already completed the Front End Certification Program and now I'm focused on the Back End Cert. I'm learning how to develop solutions with node.js + express + mongoDB.

This is my second API Project. I hope you like it!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### OBJECTIVE:
Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://timestamp-ms.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Glitch.

NOTE: for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch project. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### USER STORIES:

1. I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).

2. If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.

3. If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
